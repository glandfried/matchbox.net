Exploration 1
======
Train:
- movie 0 has been rated by users 1 to 5 (we have info about the movie) with MAX_SCORE
- user 0 has rated movies 1 to 5 with MIN_SCORE (we have info about the user)
Predict:
- User 0's rating of movie 0, which is MAX_SCORE
Hypothesis:
Predicted result will be somewhere in the middle of MIN_SCORE and MAX_SCORE
Result:
   userId  movieId  y_test  timestamp  y_pred  y_proba_1  y_proba_2  y_proba_3  y_proba_4  y_proba_5  y_proba_6
0       0        0       6       1000       1   0.298267   0.055791   0.140238   0.149482   0.144009   0.212213

Predicted result was MIN_SCORE, next highest probability was MAX_SCORE

Exploration 2
======
Train:
- Same as Exploration 1, but user 1 has rated movies 2 to 5 with MIN_SCORE, same as user 0
Predict:
- User 0's rating of movie 0, which is MAX_SCORE

Exploration 3
======
Train:
- movie 0 has been rated by users 1 to 5 (we have info about the movie) with MAX_SCORE
- user 0 has rated movies 1 to 5 with MAX_SCORE (we have info about the user)
Predict:
- User 0's rating of movie 0, which is MAX_SCORE

Exploration 4
======
Train:
- movie 0 has been rated by users 1 to 5 (we have info about the movie) with MAX_SCORE
- user 0 has rated movies 1 to 5 with 3 (we have info about the user)
- user 1 has rated movies 1 to 5 with 3
Predict:
- User 0's rating of movie 0, which is MAX_SCORE

Exploration 5
======
Same as exploration 4 but user 0 and 1 rate movies 1 to 5 with 2

Exploration 6
======
Same as exploration 5 but users 1 to 5 also rate movies 7, 8, 9 with MAX_SCORE

hypothesis: predicted probabilities will be even more polarised towards ratings 2 and MAX_SCORE.
result:

Exploration 7
======
Users 1 to 5 rate movies 1 to 5 the same value as their movie id. They also rate movie 0 with MAX_SCORE.
